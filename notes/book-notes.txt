book uses left handed coordinates
    fingers up, thumb in positive x, positive z is direction of palm
    basically, z points "out"

i'm always wondering about the true difference between points and vectors
here, they are distinguished by a bit in the 4 position of a tuple
    consequences of addition
        can't add points (fourth would be 2)
        a vector plus a point is a point
        a vector plus a vector is a vector
        a point minus a point is a vector
        can't subtract a point from a vector

it kind of makes sense that points are marked by a one and vectors are a 0, since a point is "more than" a vector

the result of the javascript expression .1 + .2 is .30000000000000004 and the result of .1 + .2 === .3 is false
    Use Number.EPSILON to skirt around this
