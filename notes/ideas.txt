a vector is "dislodged point"
    a point who's origin can be anywhere
    a sub-coordinate-system
    a portable coordinate system
    an abstract point

coordinate systems are relative to other coordinate systems

a vector *encodes* direction and magnitude
    vec.normalize() would be equivalent to vec.magnitude = 1
        if magnitude was not an actual property of vec, and not 
        just encoded by its properties

in 2d, there is one vector perpendicular to a line
in 3d, there is a whole "circle" of vectors perpendicular to a line
but given two lines in 3d, there is only one vector that is perpendicular to both
    and we would say that it is perpendicular to the "plane" formed by those two lines

the cross product of two vectors is a vector that is perpendicular to both vectors

    a "cross product" results in a cross
    a "dot product"/"scalar produce" results in a dot/scalar

    in 3d, if the operands lie on the XY plane, it makes intuitive sense that the cross 
        product sticks straight up
    it also makes sense analytically, because each element forming x and y of the cross product
        is a multiple of z (which is 0)

    each component of the cross product is a function of the *other* two components of each operand

    consider c = cross(a, b)

        

* real numbers don't have "steps"
* (not math related) motivation to take 100 happen when 0 steps is enough
